Reassemble all the covers.

## Step 2: Connect

**Connect ZimaBlade to your drive. Here, we use an HDD as an example:**

To work properly, your drive needs data and a power supply from ZimaBlade. Use the SATA cable included in ZimaBlade package, which gets both data and power supply from ZimaBlade.

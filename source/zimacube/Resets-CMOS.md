# Why do we need to reset CMOS?
Resetting CMOS is actually restoring BIOS settings to the factory default state, which can solve many problems caused by incorrect configuration, damaged settings, or hardware changes. It is a relatively safe and simple troubleshooting method, usually as the first step in solving complex system problems.

# Specific steps

## Step 1 Turn off the computer power
Turn off the computer and disconnect the power plug to ensure that the device is completely powered off.

## Step2 Open the chassis
Carefully remove the case side cover to allow access to the main board.

## Step 5 Wait for a while
Wait for 5-10 minutes to ensure that the capacitor is fully discharged.

## Step 6 Reinstall the CMOS battery
Return the battery to its original position to ensure correct installation.

## Step7 Close the chassis
Reinstall the case side cover.

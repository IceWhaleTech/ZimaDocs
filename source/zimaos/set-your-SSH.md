# Introduction
ZimaOS supports connections for three types of terminals: computers, mobile devices, and network-attached storage (NAS) systems, ensuring versatile access and management of your data.

# SSH Connection 
ZimaOS includes an SSH toggle for easy activation, allowing you to connect via SSH. The root password must be created by connecting a monitor. Additionally, you can log in using ZimaOS user accounts.

# Built-in Web Terminal
The second option is to access the system via the web terminal using ttyd. This provides a convenient way to manage your ZimaOS directly from your browser.

Open the app store and install ttydBridge to enable seamless connections to your ZimaOS system.

ZimaOS is a lightweight NAS operating system designed for ZimaCube and other home server devices.  
This guide provides a complete step-by-step process to help you **download, flash, and install ZimaOS** quickly and successfully.

## Getting Started
To boot ZimaOS, the BIOS needs to have UEFI boot mode enabled and Secure Boot disabled.

### Step 1: Download the ZimaOS Installation Image
To get started, download the latest ZimaOS `.img` file from the official GitHub release page:  
👉 [ZimaOS GitHub Releases](https://github.com/IceWhaleTech/ZimaOS/releases)


### Step 2: Create a Bootable USB Drive
You need to flash the ZimaOS image to a USB drive. The easiest tool for this is **Balena Etcher**.

1. Download and install [**Balena Etcher**](https://etcher.balena.io/#download-etcher)  
2. Open Etcher and select the ZimaOS `.img` file.  
3. Insert your USB drive and select it as the target.  
4. Click **Flash** to start writing the image.

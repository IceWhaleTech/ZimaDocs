**🎯 Goal**
Enable [the AX210 Wi-Fi card](https://shop.zimaspace.com/products/intel-ax210-wifi-6e-pcie-card-zimaboard) on ZimaOS and connect to a wireless network—no graphical interface required.

## For ZimaOS v1.4.2 and above
The Intel AX210 is a high-performance wireless card that supports Wi-Fi 6E. Many Zima device users rely on it for wireless connectivity. This guide walks you through enabling the AX210 and connecting to Wi-Fi in a command-line-only environment.

## Step 1: Confirm AX210 is recognized 
Run the following command:
```language
lspci | grep -i network
```
You should see output similar to:

If it's not detected, ensure the card is inserted into the correct M.2 E-key slot and that the hardware is functional.
## Step 2: Connect to Wi-Fi using nmtui
ZimaOS includes the `nmtui` command-line tool. Launch it with:
```language
sudo nmtui
```
Then:
- Select `Activate a connection`

🖥️ **Optional:** View and manage network settings in the ZimaOS dashboard
If you're using the ZimaOS web UI (Dashboard), you can also view and configure network settings there.
Example:

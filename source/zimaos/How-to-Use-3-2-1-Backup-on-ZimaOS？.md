In this era of data explosion, important files not only carry the fruits of our work but also record moments of our lives. However, hard drive failures, accidental deletions, and unforeseen disasters can wipe out these precious materials in an instant.



To address this, ZimaOS v1.4.3 introduces the brand-new **3-2-1 backup feature**—a globally recognized golden standard for data protection—ensuring that every piece of your important data is safeguarded with multiple layers of protection, leaving nothing to chance.


  

### **What is the 3-2-1 backup rule?**

*   **· 3** – Keep at least **three copies** of your data (the original + two backups) to avoid single points of failure.
    
*   **· 2** – Store the copies on **two different types of media** (e.g., local hard drive, external USB, cloud storage) to diversify risk.
    
*   **· 1** – Keep at least **one copy offsite** to protect against physical threats such as fire, flood, or theft.
    

This method is a widely recognized golden backup strategy, commonly used in both enterprise and personal data protection solutions.

## New：
* **First AI Files Search:** With the rapid advancement of large model technology, we firmly believe that search and agent capabilities driven by large models will revolutionize the way information is retrieved. The First AI Files Search introduced in ZimaOS v1.3.1 leverages the localized VL large model to deliver an efficient and secure intelligent search experience for users. Unlike cloud-based solutions, the VL large model is deployed directly on your local device, ensuring maximum protection of data privacy! Combined with GPU acceleration and multimodal search technology, First AI Files Search supports cross-modal searches across dozens of file formats, delivering precise and efficient results.

* **New Advanced Network Settings:** Experience more stable and flexible connections with static IP support, full IPv4/IPv6 compatibility, and Thunderbolt bridging for faster, more reliable speeds. Special thanks to pgear , ifvelosoh , gclass , The Vanishing_Dragon , Sabitech and NeoFight for suggesting. Your ideas made this feature possible!

* **New Trash Bin in Files:** No more worries about accidentally deleting files! Automatically clear files after 30 days and easily restore deleted items. Visual management lets you see deleted files and their locations. Smarter, safer file management! Special thanks to @ fgajida for suggesting. Your ideas made this feature possible!

## Improve：
* **1s Pics Preview:** We’ve deeply optimized image cover previews. No matter how many images you have, you can quickly preview all image covers within 1 second, greatly improving file browsing efficiency.

* **Blazing Fast Uploads:** Duplicate checking for 1,000 files can be completed within 1 second, and the upload list is displayed immediately upon triggering, with no waiting required! The newly designed upload panel makes file management clearer and more efficient!

ZimaOS v1.3.1 is packed with cutting-edge features to help you stay ahead of the curve in file management and network performance. Happy managing!

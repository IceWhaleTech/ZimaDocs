**Note**:when selecting storage, please take care to select the correct disk

Because operating systems and storage vendors calculate storage space sizes differently, the capacity you see when installing your system is not the same as the hardware capacity. You can tell the difference by the type of disk and the approximate size.
The built-in storage type of the ZimaBoard is eMMC, which may also be recognized as an MMC device in the operating system.

**Attention****! You may need to modify the boot sequence in BIOS or select the boot device at boot time if you install the OS to an external hard disk.**

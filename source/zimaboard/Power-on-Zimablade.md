## Step 1: Install SO-DIMM

Reassemble all the covers.

## Step 2: Connect

**Connect ZimaBlade to your drive. Here, we use an HDD as an example:**

To work properly, your drive needs data and a power supply from ZimaBlade. Use the SATA cable included in ZimaBlade package, which gets both data and power supply from ZimaBlade.

**Connect ZimaBlade using an RJ45:**

Use the type-C cable included in ZimaBlade package.

> ZimaBlade's type-C interface supports USB PD 3.1.
> 
> For long-term use with an HDD, consider using an external power supply.

## Step 3: Boot and get the IP

Once you plug in the power, the device will automatically start. And then... boom! You're in!

You'll be prompted to enter the default account `casaos` and password `casaos` to login in.


  

**Now, get ZimaBlade's IP address:**

Type `ip addr` and press `Enter` to see the IP address. It will be somting like `192.x.x.x` or `10.0.x.x`. (depending on your LAN configuration.)

The physical network interface `enp2s0` IP address (eg :`10.0.179.111`) has been noted, and it will be used for future login attempts if needed.
> The IP addresses `127.x.x.x `(loopback) is for internal communication, `10.x.x.x `(physical interface) is for network connections, and `172.x.x.x` (Docker) is for container networking.

## Step 4: Your NAS is here!

Open a browser on your phone or desktop computer and visit the IP address you just noted.

Follow the instructions to create a Web UI account.

After creating the account, you will be logged into the CasaOS Web UI.

**Now, configure your disk.** CasaOS will detect the disk connected. Click the storage setting button, then click the "Create Storage" button.

Choose the appropriate option for your needs. Your drive is now ready to be used as storage.

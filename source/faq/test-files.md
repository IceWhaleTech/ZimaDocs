## 段落标题
Files focuses on unified management for creators and personal data, offering a streamlined storage and file access experience. It undoubtedly resembles a local cloud storage service. However, unlike mainstream cloud storage services, its speed can reach GB/s via Thunderbolt, and with Wi-Fi 6 wireless networks, it can achieve over 100MB/s in material synchronization and file preview experiences. This provides optimal speeds for backing up large quantities of personal images or video content, including 4K.

Files offers video previews, pinning, and cloud storage expansion features, effectively meeting your needs for content access and unifying data across cloud services. Common uses include sharing a set of materials within a small team or pinning your most frequently used project folders for easy access.

While 100MB/s performance generally satisfies most preview and editing needs, if you require extreme speeds, ZimaCube’s 10GbE or Thunderbolt capabilities are excellent options.

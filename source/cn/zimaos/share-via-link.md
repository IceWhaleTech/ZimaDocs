# How “Share via link“ works

### Introducation

To provide a faster, safer, and more efficient file-sharing experience, we are proud to introduce a new feature—file sharing via link, which utilizes **WebTorrent** technology.

In this article, we provide you with a brief overview of how this technology works, its technical features, and the risks that should be considered during its use. For more detailed technical information, you can refer to the [ official documentation of WebTorrent](https://github.com/webtorrent/webtorrent/blob/master/docs/faq.md).

**1.** ****What is WebTorrent Technology?****

* WebTorrent is a file-sharing protocol based on peer-to-peer (P2P) network technology, allowing users to transfer files directly between users on the network without the need for a central server.
* Compared to traditional file-sharing methods, WebTorrent offers faster download speeds and better privacy protection.

**2.** **How Does Our "Share Files via Link" Feature Work?**

* Users can create a special link through our platform, and others can access and download the file through this link.
* Files are transmitted over the WebTorrent network, ensuring the decentralization and efficiency of the transmission process.

**3.** **Technical Features of WebTorrent:**

* **Decentralization**: No central server, files are transferred directly between users.
* **Efficiency**: Leveraging the advantages of P2P networks, the more people who download, the faster the download speed.
* **Privacy Protection**：Users' data is not uploaded to a central server, reducing the risk of privacy leaks.
* **Cross- platform**：WebTorrent supports various devices and browsers, allowing users to seamlessly share files across different platforms.

**4.** **Risks Users Should Avoid When Using:**

* **Persistence of File Sharing**: Once a file is uploaded to the P2P network, it may continue to be disseminated and downloaded within the network, even if you have canceled the share.
* **Privacy Protection**: Before sharing files, please carefully consider the privacy of the file content to ensure that no sensitive or personal information is disclosed.
* **Legal Responsibility**: Ensure that you have the legal right to share the files to avoid infringing on copyright or other legal rights.
* **Cybersecurity**: Although WebTorrent provides a certain level of security protection, users should remain vigilant and regularly update their security software to prevent malware attacks.

### Conclusion

Our new feature "Share via Link," powered by WebTorrent technology, offers users a powerful, efficient, and secure file-sharing solution.

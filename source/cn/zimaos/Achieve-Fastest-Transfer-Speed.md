### If you find that the transfer speed achieved by the Zima device is lower than its maximum speed, for example in the following cases:

### Please check and upgrade the following aspects to achieve the highest speed:
1. Router issue: Choose a router with a 2.5G/10G interface that matches the performance of the ZimaCube network card. The router may have hardware failures or configuration issues, causing the network connection speed to decrease. Restarting the router and checking its settings may help resolve the issue.
2. Switch issue: If you are using a switch on your local area network, it may also have insufficient speed specifications or configuration issues. Check the switch's connections and settings to ensure everything is normal.
3. Network cable issue: Lower speed specification network cables may cause a decrease in connection speed. Check if the cables meet the highest speed requirements and try replacing the cables.
### If you have ruled out the above possibilities, try the following methods:
1. Move the Zima device to another LAN port
2. Move the router to another LAN port
3. Replace with another Ethernet cable
4. Test the transfer speed of other devices on the same network
5. Connect directly to the upstream router as much as possible
### Other factors affecting transfer speed not shown:
1. DNS server issue: Performance issues with the DNS server may affect network connection speed. Try changing the DNS server used by your computer or router, or contact your network service provider for faster DNS resolution service.
2. Firewall or security software issue: Some firewalls or security software may affect network connection speed. Try temporarily disabling these software to see if they have an impact on connection speed.

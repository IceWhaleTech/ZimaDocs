### Notes on NetworkID security:
1. If the NetworkID is leaked, your shared folders may be exposed, so please keep the NetworkID secure.
2. If you confirm it has been leaked, please click “…” to reset the NetworkID. The leak will be terminated, while existing connections and shares will become invalid.

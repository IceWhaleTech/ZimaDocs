## BigScreen access to DLNA server content

In addition to the basic Samba LAN service, ZimaBoard is also pre-deployed with miniDLNA service, which allows Oculus to easily access movies and content from your home server through a variety of applications via the DLNA server

In this tutorial, we use the BigScreen app on Oculus to play videos
